kodi (2:17.6+dfsg1-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  For a period of time it was recommended to start Kodi as a systemd
  service, but upstream does not recommend that [1] anymore. The
  recommended method now is setting up a lightweight display manager
  to log in a user automatically and starting kodi in the user's session.

  The kodi package shipped kodi.service as a disabled systemd service
  as a starting point for users to set up Kodi to run in standalone mode
  but the service file is not shipped anymore following the change in
  upstream's recommendation. If you enabled the service and used it for
  running Kodi please switch to starting it from a user session or
  install the service file from any other source.
