Description: Libretro wraper for PCSX-ReARMed
 PCSX ReARMed is yet another PCSX fork based on the PCSX-Reloaded project,
 which itself contains code from PCSX, PCSX-df and PCSX-Revolution. This
 version is ARM architecture oriented and features MIPS->ARM recompiler by
 Ari64, NEON GTE code and more performance improvements. It was created for
 Pandora handheld, but should be usable on other devices after some code
 adjustments (N900, GPH Wiz/Caanoo, PlayBook versions are also available).
 .
 PCSX ReARMed features ARM NEON GPU by Exophase, that in many cases produces
 pixel perfect graphics at very high performance. There is also Una-i's GPU
 plugin from PCSX4ALL project, and traditional P.E.Op.S. one.
